## What is Replatform?
- "Lift-and-shift" approach using the same Teradata engine in the cloud.Say for example using Teradata Vantage on Azure
## What is ReArchitect?
- Redesigning the entire workload using Azure-native services such as Azure Synapse, Data Factory, Databricks, etc. For example replace legacy Teradata procedures and logic with Azure-native components like
   - Azure Synapse,T-SQL,ADF (Azure Data Factory),Apache Spark,Databricks
## Which Approach to Choose?(Motivation Factor)
- ### Replatform
  -   Significant investments in Teradata
  -   Desire to maintain hybrid/multi-cloud architecture
  -   Existing DW/Data Mart stays in Teradata
-   ### Rearchitect
    - Migrating to Cloud native database to leverage cloud benefits with minimal to no disruptions on consumption.
    - Complete Re-engineering to Cloud native solutions to eliminate current system gaps and move to future state architecture.
    - In Preparation for Streaming work loads and, Delta Lakes and very high volume of transactions.
